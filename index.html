          Natural resources fall under the following main categories:</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline !important;">Inexhaustible Resources:</span>
          The resources which cannot be exhausted by human consumption are called inexhaustible resources. These include energy sources like solar radiation, wind power, water power and tidal power, etc.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline !important;">Exhaustible Resources:</span>
          There are some resources, which are available in limited quantities and are going to be exhausted as a result of continuous use. For example, the stock of coal in the earth is limited and one day there will be no more coal available for our use, if we keep on using it excessively.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline !important;">Renewable Resources:</span>
        Renewable resources are those that are constantly available (like water) or can be reasonably replaced or recovered, like vegetative lands. Even though some renewable resources can be replaced, they may take many years to form and that does not make them renewable. Some of the exhaustible resources are naturally regenerated after consumption and are known as renewable resources. e.g., Forest trees and plants that make a forest may be destroyed but new ones grow in their place. But if forest is totally cut down to get land for construction of buildings, it is lost forever.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline !important;">Non-Renewable Resources:</span>
         Non-renewable resources are those that cannot easily be replaced once they are destroyed. For example, fossil fuels. Minerals are also non-renewable because even though they form naturally in a process called the rock cycle, it can take thousands of years, making it non-renewable. Non-renewable resources can be called inorganic resources if they come from non-living things. For example, minerals, wind, land, soil and rocks.

        <h5 class="u-text u-text-4">
          A resource can be defined as any natural or artificial substance, energy or organism, which is used by human being for its welfare. Ever since the earth was inhabited, humans and other life forms have depended on things that exist freely in nature to survive. These things include water, land, soils, rocks, forests, animals, fossil fuels and minerals. They are called natural resources as they are the basis of life on earth.<br>

          This word is derived from the Latin word “polluere” meaning “to soil” or “defile (contaminate)”. Pollution is caused by pollutants, which may be solid, liquid or gaseous in nature. Pollution is the effect of undesirable changes in our surroundings that have harmful effects on plants, animals and human beings. Pollutants are produced due to human activity, which have a detrimental effect on our environment. For example, factories consume a lot of water and electricity and release harmful chemicals in air, land and water, thus contaminating the atmosphere. Water pollution caused by factories and other industries can be the most serious problem. They also pollute the air through fossil fuel emissions. These emissions include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which are harmful to the living beings.<br>
